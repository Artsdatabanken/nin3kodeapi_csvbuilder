# Drupal_import
* Using export from nin3kodeapi (kodeoversikt.csv) to merge with drupal object for nin3. 
* Mapping via api.name<>drupal.title. (Also using classtype ('Hovedtypegruppe', 'Grunntype' etc. would be preferable in future))
* This mapping is the used to produce import files for Hovedtype, Grunntype to update fields in the cms(drupal), currently Langkode and title, so that langkode in nin3-hjemmeside/nin3Api matches langkode in the cms system(drupal) (this could be extended to also cover other fields in cms)
